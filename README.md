# what is this
Autogen is a multi-platform engine for automatically generating CTF challenges, designed primarily for self-study.\
\
Challenges are generated using a stack of templates to build a model of a single web server - starting with server software, then site functionality, then a vulnerability.\
\
Autogen supports dynamic content within templates, allowing for a huge number of permutations on a single challenge format.\
\
The best part? It's as simple as running a Python script*.

Autogen runs on templates. We can never be short on templates! Since each template type is modular, templates is incredibly simple.\
Take a look at the wiki (you should add the wiki here plaao) to learn more.
